The maximum is 15 kg --> ~150 N.
"Efficiency" = force / total member length

pylon_1:
    Net Force: <150 (exceeds critical load)
    Efficiency: 0.3803
pylon_2:
    Net Force: <150 (exceeds critical load)
    Efficiency: 0.3967

Note: Subsequent listings will target (150 / 4) = 37.5 N because there are four sides to the tower.
Disregard pylons 1 and 2?

pylon_3:
    Net Force: 37.5 N
    Efficiency: 0.1006

pylon_4 (optimized for physical construction):
    Net Force: 37.5 N
    Efficiency: 0.0995

conventional_1 (optimized for physical construction):
    Net Force: 37.5 N
    Efficiency: 0.1247
    (Why must the boring designs be the most effective?)
    (I was personally hoping for the pylons.)

conventional_optimized (optimized only for critical load):
    Net Force: 37.5 N
    Efficiency: 0.1181
    (Interesting...)
